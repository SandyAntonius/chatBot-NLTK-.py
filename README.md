= Simple NLP-Based FAQ Chatbot

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Internship and focuses on creating a basic FAQ chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes the NLTK library to process user input and match it with pre-defined questions to generate responses.

----------------------------------------------

= Project Description

A terminal-based chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions about a *bakery store*. The bot uses word tokenization and lemmatization to understand user queries and returns the most relevant answer from a predefined dictionary.

= Features:

* Responds to real-time user input in the terminal
* Matches questions based on word similarity
* Uses NLTK for text preprocessing
* Press `bye` to exit

----------------------------------------------

= Technologies Used

* Python 3.10+
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

----------------------------------------------
